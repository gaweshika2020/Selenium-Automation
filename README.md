# Selenium-Automation
eBay Mobile Phone Purchase Automation
This Selenium automation project demonstrates a step-by-step scenario for purchasing a mobile phone on eBay.com. It utilizes Java, TestNG, and Selenium WebDriver to interact with the eBay website, performing actions like searching for a mobile phone, selecting a specific item, adding it to the cart, and verifying key details throughout the process. The project is structured with TestNG annotations, parameterized methods, and assertions for robust testing, and it can be easily extended for parallel execution across different browsers.
